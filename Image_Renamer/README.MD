# Bulk Midjourney Image Renamer

This Python script renames images in a folder based on specific rules. It removes UUIDs and username, then adds a counter if a filename collision occurs.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Modify the `folder_path` in `main.py` to point to the folder containing the images.
3. Run the script using `python main.py`.

## Important Note
- Make sure to test the script on a sample set of files before using it on important data.
