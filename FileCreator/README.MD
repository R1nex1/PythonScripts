### File Creator

This Python script allows you to create multiple folders with specified files in each folder based on a given range of folder names.

#### Instructions:
1. **Setup:**
   - Replace `"Your directory location here"`, `"Start folder name here"`, and `"End folder name here"` with your desired directory path, start folder name, and end folder name respectively.
   - Update the `file_names` list with the names of the files you want to create in each folder.

2. **Functionality:**
   - The script will create folders named from the start folder to the end folder (inclusive) with the specified files in each folder.
   - The folder names are generated by appending numbers to the prefix extracted from the start folder name.

3. **Usage:**
   - Run the script to generate the folders and files as specified.
   - Ensure proper permissions to create folders and files in the specified directory.

#### Example:
- If `start_folder = "Day1"` and `end_folder = "Day3"`, the script will create folders named `"Day1"`, `"Day2"`, and `"Day3"` with the specified files in each folder.

Feel free to customize the script parameters to suit your folder structure and file requirements.
